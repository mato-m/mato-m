|:-------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Vehicle counting    | YOLO           | This project utilizes a pretrained YOLO model that recognizes vehicles. It is used in order to count the number of cars that pass the specified line on the video.         | [Used video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNn9qKG2UFI)           | [yolo-vehicle-counting](https://github.com/mato-m/yolo-vehicle-counting)        |
| Grapevine disease classification    | ResNet50    |  This project uses ResNet50, a pretrained convolutional neural network, in order to classify images of grapevines based on its condition or disease. The model achieved the accuracy higher than 99% on both the training and the test dataset.     | [Grapevine disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rm1000/grape-disease-dataset-original)       | [resnet-grape](https://github.com/mato-m/resnet-grape)   |

| Wine clustering    | K-means<br/>Principal component analysis    | This model uses K-means in order to cluster wine based on different parameters such as alcohol levels, magnesium levels and color intensity. Using both elbow method and silhouette score it was determined that the optimal number of clusters is 6. Principal component analysis was used in order to visually represent the result on a 2D chart.     | [Wine dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harrywang/wine-dataset-for-clustering)       | [kmeans-wine](https://github.com/mato-m/kmeans-wine)   |
